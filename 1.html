  hello web! 반가워!

  <br><br>Don't be that way
  Fall apart twice a day
  I just wish you could feel what you say
  Show, never tell
  But I know you too well
  Kind of mood that you wish you could sell

  <br><br>If teardrops could be bottled
  There'd be swimming pools filled by models
  Told a tight dress is what makes you a whore
  If "I love you" was a promise
  Would you break it, if you're honest
  Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
  I don't wanna be you anymore

  <p>Hands. hands getting cold
  Losing feeling is getting old
  Was I made from a broken mold?
  Hurt, I can't shake
  We've made every mistake
  Only you know the way that I break</p>
